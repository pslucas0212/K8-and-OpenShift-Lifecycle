Notes From kubernetes.io:
- The Kubernetes project maintains release branches for the most recent three minor releases (1.24, 1.23, 1.22). Kubernetes 1.19 and newer receive approximately 1 year of patch support.
- Kubernetes releases currently happen approximately four times per year. Paul comment: Reviewing the information at kubernetes.io, it looks like the project may be shifting to three release per year.
